## Descriptive format for saving files:
- we need to save files with a format similar to step files

The following needs to be included:
- BasePlane
    - Link
        - Attributes
            - ID
            - NAME
            - MATES
                - MATE ID? and then put all the mate info in different section?
                - MATE_TYPE (e.g. prismatic, fixed)
                - PARENT
                - LOCATION (U V)
        - Child planes

Similar formats to look for inspiration:
